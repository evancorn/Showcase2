Capstone project for the IBM DATA SCIENCE PROFESSIONAL CERTIFICATE

This project consists of Data Collection, Web Scraping for Data, Data Wrangling, Exploratory Data Analysis with SQL and Visualization using Pandas/Matplotlib/Folium.
After collection/visualization the datasets are used in Machine Learning models to try and predict whether or not a rocket would crash/land. The models are then compared 
and the best one must be chosen.
